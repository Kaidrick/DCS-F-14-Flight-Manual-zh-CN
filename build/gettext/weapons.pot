The gun rate is selected by the GUN RATE switch on the ACM which also indicates selected option. Selection of ACM will set it to high automatically. The WCS can however provide symbology on the HUD to increase gun accuracy. For both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes the gun has two sights available.

AIM-7 Sparrow missile is a medium range air-to-air missile with a max range of at least 16 NM (30 km) for the AIM-7E and at least 38 NM (70 km) for the AIM-7F and AIM-7M. The all weather capability comes from the missile being radar guided, more exactly SARH (semi-active radar homing).

It also injects CW radar video from the radar to the missiles via an emitter on the aft end of the rail to a receiver at the aft end of the missile.

When using CW in the normal mode the AN/AWG-9 radar uses a dedicated CW antenna to spotlight the tracked target more directly than via the flood antenna. While CW is the normal guidance mode for all AIM-7 variants it is possible to select the pulse doppler guidance mode instead when using the AIM-7F and AIM-7M missiles."
msgstr ""

msgid "The AIM-9G introduced a seeker head capable of the Sidewinder expanded acquisition mode (SEAM) and all later Sidewinders carried by the F-14 are also capable of that mode. The SEAM allows the missile seeker head to be uncaged to track a target within the seeker limits (40° from ADL) allowing the pilot to lead the target, improving missile performance. It also allows for the WCS on the F-14 to slave the seeker to a tracked target within 20° from ADL, allowing for off boresight acquisition."
msgstr ""

msgid "The AIM-9 on the F-14 can still use the old boresight mode where the seeker head remains slaved to ADL (2.5° field of view) but normally SEAM is used to scan the seeker about either ADL or a tracked target. This seeker scan is along a back-to-back double-D scan pattern, basically a scan cone about 6° wide covered in around 3 seconds. (Pictured above.) Like in all Sidewinders target detection is indicated by an aural tone. That growling tone is present while scanning but increases in intensity while the seeker is looking at an IR-source."

The weapon selector can be used to cycle which AIM-9 that is selected for launch by depressing it, indicating on the ACM panel which missile is selected by a checkerboard indication in the corresponding status window. When using the AIM-9 the HUD uses the diamond to indicate a tracked target and the pipper (crosshair) to indicate current seeker head position. If a WCS track with range is available the HUD also displays range to target and Rmin and Rmax. The VDI, DDD and TID displays the attack guidance symbology if a WCS track is present."
