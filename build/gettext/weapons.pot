The maximum number of bullets fired by a trigger pull can be set to be either 50, 100, 200 or unlimited. The default value is 200 bullets but can be set otherwise by the ground crew."

The SEAM allows the missile seeker head to be uncaged to track a target within the seeker limits (40° from ADL) allowing the pilot to lead the target, improving missile performance. It also allows for the WCS on the F-14 to slave the seeker to a tracked target within 20° from ADL, allowing for off boresight acquisition."

This scan is not visual to the pilot and is done to increase effective seekerhead field of view. Like in all Sidewinders target detection is indicated by an aural tone.
