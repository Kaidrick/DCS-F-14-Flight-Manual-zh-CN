msgid "Engines and Throttle Controls"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:7
msgid "The two F110-GE-400 afterburning turbo-fans powering the F-14B are controlled by the AFTC (Augmenter Fan Temperature Control unit). The AFTC is akin to an early version of a FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) used on newer turbine engines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:10
msgid "The AFTC controls both the engine itself as well as the variable exhaust nozzles controlling the engine exhaust gases. Additionally, the AICS (Air Inlet Control System) helps by controlling the engine airflow for an even subsonic airflow to the engine inlets. This is done through the variable geometry intakes, more precisely the variable ramps in the intakes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:14
msgid "All this is achieved by the AFTC and AICS using appropriate sensor inputs which then control engine operations according to programmed schedules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:16
msgid "In addition both engines also drive separate fuel, hydraulic and electric generators to create redundancy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:18
msgid "In case of a failure in the AFTC the MEC (Main engine control) is capable of assuming control of the engines to provide a fall-back, mechanical control. The normal mode, AFTC, is the primary mode (PRI) and called as such while the fall-back MEC is the secondary (SEC) mode. The selection of primary or secondary is automatic in case of a failure in the AFTC but can also be manually selected. Of note is that in secondary mode the engine nozzles are fully closed and disabled in addition to the afterburners being disabled with a corresponding loss of engine performance."

msgid "Throttle Controls"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:31
msgid "The throttles in the F-14 have detents preventing unintentional engine start and shutdown and unintentional selection of afterburner. In addition the throttles also controls several different systems depending on throttle position as shown in the diagram above. The most critical of these being the fuel cutoff and ignition systems in the respective engines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:35
msgid "For throttle operations there are three modes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:37
msgid "The manual mode is a mechanical mode in which the engines are controlled by mechanical linkages directly from the throttles to the engines. The manual mode is designed as a backup mode and may be inexact becuase of the mechanical nature of the controls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:40
msgid "Boost mode is the normal mode of operation in which electrical paths control actuators moving the same engine controls as the mechanical linkages but more exactly and with lesser force required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:42
msgid "The third mode is the approach power compensator mode or the auto throttle mode which is a system which allows for automatic throttle control for optimal angle-of-attack during approaches."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:44
msgid "The controls for the throttle mode are located on the inlet ramps/throttle control panel to the side of the main throttles and allows for selection of all three modes. The auto throttle mode is solenoid held and will revert to boost mode if the criteria for automatic controls are not met."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:47
msgid "To allow selection of auto mode the throttles need to be between 75 to 90% rpm, the gear handle needs to be down and with no weight on the wheels. If these criteria are no longer met, the throttles are manually overriden with force or the Cage/SEAM button on the left throttle is depressed the solenoid releases the switch and it reverts to boost."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:50
msgid "For additional autothrottle tune the gain of the system can be set on the inlet ramps/throttle control panel. The settings are hot, normal or cold with hot increasing the throttle gain (and effective thrust) and cold decreasing it. These settings correspond to cold or hot external temperatures but should be set according to observed throttle control."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:53
msgid "The RATS or reduced arrestment thrust system is a system limiting engine thrust after touchdown to limit it to levels appropriate for carrier environments. The system is enabled by weight on either main landing gear and is disabled by selection of afterburner on the throttles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:56
msgid "Finally, and implemented on the F110-GE-400, is the asymmetric limiter, preventing asymmetric afterburner engagement if only one afterburner lights by keeping that afterburner at minimum afterburner thrust until the other afterburner also lights."

msgid "Engine and Throttle Control Switches and Indicators"
msgstr ""

msgid "The **THROTTLE TEMP** (**2**) switch controls the gain of the automatic throttle system also described above."
msgstr ""

msgid "The **INLET RAMPS** (**3**) switches enable (**AUTO**) or disable, stow (**STOW**) the variable intake ramps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:78
msgid "The engine crank switch (**4**) is used to crank the engines to 20% rpm allowing for engine start by moving the respective throttle to idle from cut-off. The air to start the engine is sourced from an external air supply if connected or the other engine if no external source exists. At 50% rpm the crank switch automatically returns to off/center position. If this does not occur it should be manually set to off to prevent damage to the air turbine starter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:82
msgid "The **BACK UP IGNITION** (**5**) switch enables the backup ignition system in case of a failure in the main ignition circuits that are normally enabled by moving the throttles out of the cut-off position."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:86
msgid "The **ENG/PROBE ANTI-ICE** (**2**) switch on the external environmental control panel enables the engine anti-ice and intake ramp anti-ice mode in addition to the various probe heaters. The **ORIDE** position enables the system, the **AUTO** position enables the system if icing is detected and the **OFF** position disable it."
