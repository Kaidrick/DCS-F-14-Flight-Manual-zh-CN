msgid "The F-14A is powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-414A while the F-14B is powered by two General Electrics F110-GE-400, both of which are afterburning turbofan engines."

#: ../../source/general.rst:9
msgid "To provide the engines with an even subsonic airflow the F-14 has the AICS or Air Inlet Control System. This system controls the variable geometry intakes by moving the variable ramps mounted in them to slow the airflow. This is accomplished using various sensor inputs run through a calculation using set schedules which decides the positions of the ramps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:11
msgid "In addition, the TF30 uses two systems to improve reliable operation, the Mid Compression Bypass System (MCB) and the Mach Lever."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:13
msgid "The MCB helps mitigate high angle of attack airflow onto the compressor fans to reduce the risk of an engine stall. This system vents air from the compressor section to bypass duct to stabilize the airflow for later compressor stages. Normally this system uses angle of attack and Mach number sensor data to activate, but with the landing gear handle in the down position this it is only activated with zone 5 afterburner. Additionally the WCS commands the MCB to activate with extension of the refuelling probe as well as when launching AIM-7 or AIM-9 missiles, air to ground rockets or firing the M61 Vulcan gun."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:15
msgid "The Mach Lever also mitigates the risk of an engine stall by controlling min and max rpm allowed as a function of Mach number. In addition it also increases the minimum rpm in high angle of attack regimes while subsonic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:17
msgid "The two F110s in F-14B, on the other hand, are controlled by the AFTC (Augmenter Fan Temperature Control unit). The AFTC is an early engine control computer akin to an early version of a FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) used on newer turbine engines. This system controls both the engine itself as well as the variable exhaust nozzles controlling the engine exhaust gases and removes the need for the MCB and Mach Lever for the F110. The lack of such a system in the F-14A controlling its TF30s is one of the reasons for them being deemed less reliable than the F110s."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/general.rst:19
msgid "In case of a failure in the AFTC the MEC (Main engine control) is capable of assuming control of the engines to provide a fall-back, mechanical control. The normal mode, AFTC, is the primary mode (PRI) and called as such while the fall-back MEC is the secondary (SEC) mode. The selection of primary or secondary is automatic in case of a failure in the AFTC but can also be manually selected. Of note is that in secondary mode the engine nozzles are fully closed and disabled in addition to the afterburners being disabled with a corresponding loss of engine performance."

msgid "The main difference between the TF30 and F110 engines (apart from lesser thrust in the TF30s) is that the TF30s are more sensitive to the quality of the airflow entering the compressor face. In general it is wise to avoid anything less than military power or afterburner while in high angle of attack maneuvers as well as avoiding large rudder inputs or asymmetric engine throttle settings. That said, the TF30s in the HB F-14A module have been extensively tuned using available data and SME expertise, resulting in an accurate modelling of an engine undeserving of its bad reputation. One \"advantage\" of the TF30's mechanical fuel control is its high speed thrust, resulting in higher top speeds than the F110 can achieve. If flown within normal parameters, the TF30 engines behave well if a tad underpowered compared to the F110s."
